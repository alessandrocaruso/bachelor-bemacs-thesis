The estimation of the disclosure risk is an essential measure that statistical agencies undertake to protect an individualâ€™s privacy while releasing consistent and informative data. In the literature, this problem has been analyzed from a parametric and non- parametric Bayesian perspective and through different statistical models, such as the Dirichlet-Multinomial, the Poisson-Gamma, and even with mixed effects and log-linear models. This paper aims to find an estimator of the disclosure risk on tabular micro-data sets. The Bayesian parametric model for the estimation of the disclosure risk proposed is based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution. Testing the model on real and simulated datasets reveals that it performs well under certain conditions, giving a close estimate of the actual information disclosure risk.
